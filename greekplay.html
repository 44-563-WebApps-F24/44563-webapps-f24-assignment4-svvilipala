        <h1>Sri Vidya Vilipala presents a Greek play by Sophocles</h1>
        <h3>AIAS - Author Sophocles</h3>
        <p class="direction">
        _CHORUS (_re-entering severally_)._
        </p>
        <br>
<h5 class="name CHA">CH. A.</h5>  
<p class="speech">
    Toil upon toil brings toil,
        And what save trouble have I?
        Which path have I not tried?
        And never a place arrests me with its tale.
        Hark! lo, again a sound!
        </p>
<h5 class="name CHB">CH. B.</h5>  
<p class="speech">'Tis we, the comrades of your good ship's crew.</p>
<h5 class="name CHA">CH. A.</h5>  <p class="speech"> Well, sirs? </p>
<h5 class="name CHB">CH. B.</h5> <p class="speech"> We have trodden all the westward arm o' the bay.</p>
<h5 class="name CHA">CH. A.</h5> <p class="speech">  Well, have ye found? </p>
<h5 class="name CHB">CH. B.</h5> <p class="speech"> Troubles enow, but nought to inform our sight. </p>
<h5 class="name CHA">CH. A.</h5> <p class="speech"> Nor yet along the road that fronts the dawn
        Is any sign of Aias to be seen.
        </p>
<h5 class="name CH">CH.</h5> <p class="speech">Who then will tell me, who? What hard sea-liver,                 1
        What toiling fisher in his sleepless quest,
    What Mysian nymph, what oozy Thracian river,
        Hath seen our wanderer of the tameless breast?
            Where? tell me where!
    'Tis hard that I, far-toiling voyager,
          Crossed by some evil wind,
          Cannot the haven find,
    Nor catch his form that flies me, where? ah! where?
