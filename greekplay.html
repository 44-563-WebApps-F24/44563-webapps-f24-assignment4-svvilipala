        <h1>Sri Vidya Vilipala presents a Greek play by Sophocles</h1>
        <h3>AIAS - Author Sophocles</h3>
        <p>
        CHORUS (_re-entering severally_).
        <br>
CH. A.  Toil upon toil brings toil,
        And what save trouble have I?
        Which path have I not tried?
        And never a place arrests me with its tale.
        Hark! lo, again a sound!
        <br>
CH. B.  'Tis we, the comrades of your good ship's crew.
<br>
CH. A.  Well, sirs?
<br>
CH. B.  We have trodden all the westward arm o' the bay.
<br>
CH. A.  Well, have ye found?
<br>
CH. B.  Troubles enow, but nought to inform our sight.
<br>
CH. A.  Nor yet along the road that fronts the dawn
        Is any sign of Aias to be seen.
        <br>
CH. Who then will tell me, who? What hard sea-liver,                 1
        What toiling fisher in his sleepless quest,
    What Mysian nymph, what oozy Thracian river,
        Hath seen our wanderer of the tameless breast?
            Where? tell me where!
    'Tis hard that I, far-toiling voyager,
          Crossed by some evil wind,
          Cannot the haven find,
    Nor catch his form that flies me, where? ah! where?
